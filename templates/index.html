     <li>Okay, so I guess the idea behind this was to throw together a quick and
         dirty project (with D3?? are you nuts??) that essentially acts as a
         github choropleth map for life. Or at least life goals. Or maybe just
         "Things I'd Like To Make Sure I Keep Doing on a Consistent Basis".</li>

      <li>The title comes from the fact that none of these activities is all that hard.
          Figuring out a way to make them a consistent part of your routine though, is.
          So this is a tool to try and do just that.</li>

        <li>So obviously this thing was started right around new years, right?</li>

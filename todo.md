okay, this is just getting fucking stupid.

I
1) This needs to be a SIMPLE project.
2) Just use the god damn django admin as an entry point to DB ops
2a) Fuck doing it client side for now.  That can come later

II
Devise a way to have major completion and minor completion events.  
There is a distinct difference there.  How do we model that?
How do we present that? (without minor looking like a failure).

III
SERIOUSLY rethink using D3 for this.  Or if D3 is going to be used,
WAY more research is needed on it to do what we want.

IT SHOULD NOT BE THIS FUCKING UNINTUITIVE AND HARD TO MAKE SIMPLE SHIT.

coding without smoking is hard... :<

/RANT.
